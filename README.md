Touristic data represent a valuable and useful source of knowledge for local administrators. Using visualization systems helps them in understanding the main trends of touristic flows directed to the different attractions of their territory and thus it supports their decision making processes. In fact, the problem of visualizing flows of people (or other entities) between geographical places has recently received a considerable attention in the Information Visualization literature. With respect to this problem, the particular setting we study in this paper poses additional challenges in the design of an effective visualization system. To cope with these challenges VisFLOWer is a system for the visual analysis of touristic flows from a set of places of origin (e.g., countries) to a set of local destinations (e.g., cities).
